                    <p>The Sivaganga graphite is of flaky nature with 14% average fixed carbon content. TAMIN has over 600 acres (243 Hects) of graphite bearing land in Pudupatti, Kumaripatti and Senthiudayanathapuram villages of Sivaganga taluk, Sivagangai District, Tamil Nadu. The estimated reserve of graphite ore in leasehold area is three million tonnes.
                        The Sivaganga graphite plant was established during December 1994 near the mine at Senthi Udayanathapuram Village, Sivaganga District, Tamil Nadu at the project cost of Rs.28 crores. Plant process capacity is 200 tonnes ore per day and production capacity is 20 tonnes on average of beneficiated graphite up to 96% FC per day.
                        Applications:
                        Graphite finds application in the manufacture of Magnesia - carbon refractory bricks for lining furnaces. Graphite crucibles for melting non-ferrous metals. Carbon brushes, Paints, Lubricants, Graphite brake lining and clutches for automobiles, Pencils etc. are produced from TAMIN Flaky graphite.
